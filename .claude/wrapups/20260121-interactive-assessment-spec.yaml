  branch: feature/interactive-assessment-tools

summary: |
  Conducted detailed interview to spec out interactive assessment tools for the AIQ Framework.
  Created comprehensive implementation specification covering all 3 levels, JSON schema design,
  org aggregation tools, and visual dashboard. Added live Mermaid diagram to landing page.
  Updated README and CLAUDE.md with current project state.

changes:
  - file: docs/specs/interactive-assessment-tools.md
    description: Created comprehensive 950-line implementation spec covering L1/L2/L3 tools, JSON schema, aggregator, dashboard

  - file: docs/index.html
    description: Added collapsible Mermaid flowchart diagram at bottom (renders via CDN, no plugins needed)

  - file: README.md
    description: Updated with interactive tools info, correct SCOREs dimensions, org aggregation instructions

  - file: CLAUDE.md
    description: Updated project structure, key technical decisions, working with assessment tools guidance

discoveries:
  - JSON should be primary output (not PDF) for org-wide aggregation
  - Schema versioning essential for future compatibility ("schemaVersion": "1.0")
  - L2 peer validation can work without backend using URL-encoded state (base64 in URL params)
  - Empty strings preferred over "N/A" for missing data (enables numeric calculations)
  - Mermaid.js from CDN renders diagrams universally without requiring user plugins
  - Folder-per-period convention (2025-Q1/, 2025-Q2/) enables trends-over-time analysis
  - Browser cannot scan file system - L3 desktop scanner requires signed Electron/Tauri app (future)

decisions:
  - All 3 levels output JSON; PDFs are human-readable derivatives
  - L2 uses two pages: level2.html (assessee) + level2-validate.html (validator via shared URL)
  - L3 MVP: role-based evidence guides + form with tool metrics (not automated scanner)
  - Python aggregator outputs CSV + stats JSON + combined JSON for dashboard
  - Dashboard has 4 views: Score Distribution, Skill Gaps, Leaderboard, Trends
  - Clean corporate design (Stripe/Notion aesthetic) with new color palette
  - CDN dependencies (html2pdf.js, Chart.js, Mermaid.js) - internet required

next_steps:
  - Merge PR #2 to see Mermaid diagram live on GitHub Pages
  - Start new session with orchestrator prompt to implement all tools in parallel
  - Phase 1: CSS + shared.js + JSON schema (parallel)
  - Phase 2: index.html redesign + level1/2/3 pages (parallel)
  - Phase 3: JSON export + PDF generator (parallel)
  - Phase 4: aggregate.py + dashboard.html (parallel)
  - Future: Signed desktop app for L3 automated scanning

  - docs/js/shared.js
  - docs/js/assessment.js
  - docs/js/peer-form.js

prompt_for_next_session: |
  I'm implementing interactive assessment tools for the AIQ Framework. The spec is complete at `docs/specs/interactive-assessment-tools.md` - read it first.

  **Your role: Orchestrator.** Use agents in parallel to maximize speed. Do NOT do the work yourself - delegate everything to Task agents.

  ## Files to Create

  **Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure (parallel):**
  - Agent 1: `docs/css/styles.css` - clean corporate design system (colors, typography, components per spec)
  - Agent 2: `docs/js/shared.js` - common utilities, role weights, dimension data, score calculation
  - Agent 3: `docs/schemas/aiq-report-v1.schema.json` - formal JSON Schema per spec

  **Phase 2 - Assessment Pages (parallel, after Phase 1):**
  - Agent 4: `docs/index.html` - redesigned landing page with 3 quick-start buttons + accordions
  - Agent 5: `docs/level1.html` + `docs/js/assessment.js` - self-assessment survey
  - Agent 6: `docs/level2.html` + `docs/level2-validate.html` + `docs/js/peer-form.js` - peer validation with URL encoding
  - Agent 7: `docs/level3.html` - evidence collection guides + form for all 7 roles, 10 tools

  **Phase 3 - Output Generation (parallel, after Phase 2):**
  - Agent 8: `docs/js/json-export.js` - JSON report generation for all levels
  - Agent 9: `docs/js/pdf-generator.js` - html2pdf wrapper with simple templates

  **Phase 4 - Org Tools (parallel, after Phase 3):**
  - Agent 10: `docs/tools/aggregate.py` - Python aggregator (CSV + stats JSON + combined JSON)
  - Agent 11: `docs/tools/dashboard.html` - Chart.js dashboard with 4 views
  - Agent 12: `docs/tools/README.md` - org admin instructions

  ## Key Technical Decisions (from spec)
  - JSON is primary output, PDFs secondary
  - Schema version "1.0" in all outputs
  - Empty strings for missing data (not "N/A")
  - L2 uses URL-encoded base64 state (no backend)
  - html2pdf.js and Chart.js from CDN
  - Mobile responsive required

  ## Dependencies
  - Read `docs/ai_mastery_eval.md` for dimension rubrics, role weights, score bands
  - Read `docs/specs/interactive-assessment-tools.md` for full implementation details

  Start by reading the spec, then launch Phase 1 agents in parallel. Report back when each phase completes before starting the next.
