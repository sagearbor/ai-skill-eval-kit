session:
  date: 2025-01-26
  duration: ~2 hours
  type: interview/spec-writing

summary: |
  Interviewed user about colleague feedback on AIQ scoring framework. Colleague
  concerned about low scores (33%) and complexity of role/company weight matrix.
  Designed and documented v1.1 spec with reduced roles, company modifiers, and
  new dual scoring system (Personal vs Corporate).

changes:
  created:
    - /home/scb2/role-company-weights-v1.1-updated.md  # needs to be moved to docs/specs/

decisions_made:
  roles:
    - Reduced from 8 to 5 roles
    - "General, Developer, Researcher, Support, Leader"
    - Researcher combines Data/ML + Research Scientist
    - Support combines PM + Ops + Legal

  company_modifiers:
    - Three profiles: Startup, Enterprise, Aspirational
    - Uses multipliers (not additive deltas) to avoid negative weights
    - "Startup: Output 1.4x, Copy 0.7x, Ethical 0.7x"
    - "Enterprise: Copy 1.2x, Output 0.8x"
    - "Aspirational: Study 0.8x, Research 1.2x, Ethical 1.2x"

  dual_scoring:
    - Personal Readiness: knowledge/skills focused (Study/Copy heavy)
    - Corporate Impact: deployment/governance focused (Output/Ethical heavy)
    - Gap indicator shows readiness vs opportunity mismatch
    - Solves "devs penalized for slow orgs" problem

  config:
    - Weights moved to external JSON (docs/config/weights-config.json)
    - Schema bumped to v1.1 with backward compat for v1.0
    - Role-specific level descriptions for Output, Research, Ethical (102 total)

  ui:
    - Dual score display as default
    - "Show all company profiles" toggle (checkbox + URL param)
    - "Show combined score" toggle for legacy view
    - Company Type dropdown on L1/L2 forms

discoveries:
  - Original 8 roles had significant overlap (PM vs Ops, Data/ML vs Research)
  - Additive weight deltas can push dimensions to 0% - multipliers avoid this
  - Colleague's YouTube team wants "startup mindset" despite being enterprise
  - Low scores (33%) primarily from L1 evidence multiplier (0.6x) + low Output level

open_questions:
  - Default company type: None vs required selection?
  - HR reporting: which score is primary for performance reviews?
  - Gap thresholds: are 30/10/-10 point cutoffs correct?

next_steps:
  - Move spec file to docs/specs/role-company-weights-v1.1.md
  - Fix file ownership (sudo chown -R sandboxuser:sandboxuser)
  - Implement spec overnight (prompt provided to user)
  - Test with colleague's team at YouTube

files_to_move:
  - from: /home/scb2/role-company-weights-v1.1-updated.md
    to: docs/specs/role-company-weights-v1.1.md
