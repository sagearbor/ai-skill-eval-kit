  HTML assessment tool, set up GitHub Pages, and configured sandboxuser for autonomous
  git operations.

discoveries:
  - SSH keys work for sandboxuser git operations after adding to GitHub
  - gh CLI authentication works in WSL even when browser fails to auto-open (use manual URL)
  - Consolidating 4 verification levels to 3 (Self, Peer, Auto/Audit) simplified the framework
  - GitHub Pages serves from /docs folder with index.html as landing page

next_steps:
  - Copy tmp/sandboxCC-guide.md to original location outside repo
  - Use interview mode to plan interactive "easy button" features
  - Level 1 (Self): Survey that outputs downloadable report
  - Level 2 (Peer): TBD - shareable assessment or template
  - Level 3 (Auto/Audit): Downloadable scanner for AI usage detection
  - Delete tmp/ folder after copying guide out
