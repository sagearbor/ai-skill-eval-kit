--- Documentation Artifacts ---

We keep /build/ in the repo per your requirement to have the DOCX downloadable,

but we ignore local temporary files created by editors or Pandoc.

*.tmp
*.log

--- Python Environment (Recommended) ---

Even if only using Pandoc, these protect the repo from environment clutter

pycache/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
.venv/
venv/
ENV/
env/
.env
.pytest_cache/

--- Operating System Files ---

.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

--- Editor / IDE ---

.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

--- Pandoc / LaTeX specifics ---

In case you ever run local LaTeX builds

*.aux
*.fdb_latexmk
*.fls
*.gz
*.toc
